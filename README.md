Project Title: Marketing Insights for Codex Energy Drink Expansion


Problem:


Codex, a prominent German beverage company, embarked on a journey to establish its presence in the Indian market. Several months ago, they introduced their energy drink in ten major cities across India. To ensure the success of their venture, they conducted an extensive feedback collection initiative, gathering opinions from 10,000 consumers regarding their beverages. It was my responsibility to analyze this feedback and devise a comprehensive marketing plan for the expansion of their business.

Tools & Approach:


For this project, I harnessed the power of two essential tools:

Canva: 

Canva served as my go-to online graphic design tool, allowing me to craft visually appealing and informative presentations without the need for extensive graphic design skills.


Tableau:

As a leading data visualization and business intelligence platform, Tableau played a pivotal role in my analysis and presentation of key marketing insights.


Key Findings & Solutions:


During the course of this project, I unearthed significant findings and provided actionable solutions:

Findings: 

My analysis uncovered insights related to the product itself, including areas for immediate improvement, ideal pricing strategies, marketing suggestions, campaign strategies, potential brand ambassadors, and the target audience.


Solutions: 

To capitalize on these findings and enhance Codex's market position, I recommended actions such as reformulating the drink to meet consumer preferences and implementing a targeted marketing campaign. These initiatives have the potential to significantly boost revenue.
